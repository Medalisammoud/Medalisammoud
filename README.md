<h2>üí´ About Me:</h2> <br />

As a full-stack developer with three years of professional experience, I have gained expertise in developing web applications using a variety of modern technologies. I have worked extensively with JavaScript frameworks, cloud technologies, and containerization tools to deliver high-quality software solutions.<br />

During my time at **Booster BC**, I designed and created websites for hotels and travel agencies, developing digital experiences using front-end technologies like Next.js, React.js, and Vue.js, and backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and NestJS. I also created a comprehensive booking platform that integrates flights, transfers, and hotels using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.<br />

At **SmartMarketplace**, I contributed to the design, development, and implementation of the B2B-Tunisia platform, connecting Tunisian suppliers with their partners and clients domestically and internationally. This involved using React.js for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MySQL for secure information storage.<br />

My role at **>New Security Service** allowed me to hone my skills in creating custom e-commerce websites with WordPress. I worked on a health products e-commerce project using React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL.<br />

Throughout my career, I have focused on improving website loading speed, efficiency, and responsiveness. I am skilled in identifying and resolving technical issues and errors, and I am always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with emerging technologies.<br />
